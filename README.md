# popular-movies-2
Project 2 for udacity

In this second and final stage, I have added additional functionality to the app built in Stage 1.

<b>Added more information to movie details view:</b>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).</li>
<li>Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.</li>
<li>Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button. 
This is for a local movies collection that is maintained on device and does not require an API request*.</li>
<li>Modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show favorites collection.</li>
<li>Modified the existing layouts to fully utilize the tablet real estate.</li>
</ul>
